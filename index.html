        <h2>Welcome to Zeb Dev's cozy homepage! This page is best viewed on desktop. I apologize for any inconvenience!</h2>
        <p>I have always been facinated with the internet and started teaching myself web development in early 2022. I created this page to post about my 
        hobbies and also showcase the different projects I have worked on. This page is UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Hopefully it won't be for too long. You can
        contact me by email at jholson.webdev@gmail.com and thanks for stopping by!!</p>

          <h2>Site/Life Updates</h2>
          <p>9/26/23: <br/> Published website and create very basic layout. Will probably revamp in the future. This is my last day off
          from a 6 day vacation. I was meaning to create this page much earlier but I got distracted by the new v2.0 Cyberpunk 2077 update.
          I'll try to hold off from getting Phantom Liberty for a few months. In addition to working on this site I am starting my next
          Javascript project, plus working my day job..</p>
          <p>9/27/23: <br/> Added the About page and wrote some rambling shit about life and my dislike of modern big tech companies. Also
          added the main project's page. After that it won't take very long to upload the stuff I already have done. Plus I'm getting a new font 
          for the website. The one I had looked like poo. Next I will get a better color scheme for the site.</p>
          <p>9/28/23: <br/> Changed the color scheme to a black and green/amber color you would see on an old computer terminal. Paired that with
          a brand new font that had the old school computer feel to it. Also added a digital clock to the header. Next I was thinking since I have
          the 'food' tag on this page I will be adding a recipe page of some of my favorite stuff to make! Stay tuned!</p>
          <p>9/29/23: <br/> Linked the recipe main page. It's just a stub for now. I'm working on the first recipe, Baked Cavatelli, because I 
          just had that for dinner the other night. Also, I'm going to do something about all this 'blank-space' in the homepage. Probably just
          fill it with cat memes. I'm still going to completely revamp the layout. I'm working on getting more proficient in CSS Grid to 
          accomplish that. Until now i've just been using Flexbox but i've always wanted to learn Grid so here we go!</p>
          <p>10/2/23: <br/> Added a few new recipes to the recipe page. I took a break the last few days. I've been working on coding
          projects for the last 8 days in a row. Decided to finish my current play-through of Cyberpunk 2077. Going to get Phantom
          Liberty this week and check that out. I'm also planning on adding a responsive photo gallery sometime this week as well. Also
          I may move these updates to their own page. We'll see...</p>
          <p>10/3/23: <br/> I finished the bulk of my latest project tonight. It's a Javascript to-do app. Super simple stuff. I linked it 
          to my projects page. Everything is saved to local storage so your tasks will be saved to the browser. Will also add a partyTime 
          button that will display cat memes. Because that's super important must have 10,000% and I will fight anyone who says otherwise!</p>
          <p>10/4/23: <br/> I removed the copyright bullshit on the footers. I realize that it was stupid to have that and then also say that
          the code is free to use. u.u S0RrY!</p>
          <p>10/4/23 (part 2): <br/> As you can see I started fucking around with sprite sheets and getting them to animate with CSS. I know they
          look bad now, but rest assured... they will maybe get better? Who knows. Shit's gonna get goofy around here though, thats for sure! </p>
