        <h2>Welcome to Zeb Dev's cozy homepage! This page is best viewed on desktop. I apologize for any inconvience!</h2>
        <p>I have always been facinated with the internet and started teaching myself web development in early 2022. I created this page to post about my 
        hobbies and also showcase the different projects I have worked on. This page is UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Hopefully it won't be for too long. You can
        contact me by email at jholson.webdev@gmail.com and thanks for stopping by!!</p>

        <h2>Site/Life Updates</h2>
        <p>9/26/23: <br/> Published website and create very basic layout. Will probably revamp in the future. This is my last day off
        from a 6 day vacation. I was meaning to create this page much earlier but I got distracted by the new v2.0 Cyberpunk 2077 update.
        I'll try to hold off from getting Phantom Liberty for a few months. In addition to working on this site I am starting my next
        Javascript project, plus working my day job..</p>
        <p>9/27/23: <br/> Added the About page and wrote some rambling shit about life and my dislike of modern big tech companies. Also
        added the main project's page. After that it won't take very long to upload the stuff I already have done. Plus I'm getting a new font 
        for the website. The one I had looked like poo. Next I will get a better color scheme for the site.</p>
        <p>9/28/23: <br/> Changed the color scheme to a black and green/amber color you would see on an old computer terminal. Paired that with
        a brand new font that had the old school computer feel to it. Also added a digital clock to the header. Next I was thinking since I have
        the 'food' tag on this page I will be adding a recipe page of some of my favorite stuff to make! Stay tuned!</p>
