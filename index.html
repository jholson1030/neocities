        <h2>Welcome to Zeb Dev's cozy homepage! About me:</h2>
        <p>I have always been facinated with the internet and started teaching myself web development in early 2022. I created this page to post about my 
        hobbies and also showcase the different projects I have worked on. This page is UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Hopefully it won't be for too long. You can
        contact me by email at jholson.webdev@gmail.com and thanks for stopping by!!</p>

        <h2>Site/Life Updates</h2>
        <p>9/26/23: <br/> Published website and create very basic layout. Will probably revamp in the future. This is my last day off
        from a 6 day vacation. I was meaning to create this page much earlier but I got distracted by the new v2.0 Cyberpunk 2077 update.
        I'll try to hold off from getting Phantom Liberty for a few months. In addition to working on this site I am starting my next
        Javascript project, plus working my day job..</p>
