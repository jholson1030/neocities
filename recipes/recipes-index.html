                    <p>This is my recipe main page. There will eventually be links to different food items that I enjoy
                        cooking. Hope you enjoy!</p>
                    <p>I’ve always loved to cook ever since I was young. I like learning about foreign countries and their 
                        cuisine and history. I’ve worked in hotels and catering companies almost all of my adult life. Even 
                        though the pay/benefits were awful, I felt that doing what I enjoyed was more important to me. A 
                        few years I had to find a new line of work due to personal health issues. It was a difficult transition 
                        at first but I ended up finding a job working at a market selling imported cheese and wine/beer/spirits. 
                        Plus I still get to cook at home which is an important part of my routine. I find it relaxing to come 
                        home at night and make something while I have a small drink. </p>
                        <p>Right now I’m getting more into learning Thai food. So many delicious dishes from there I want to try. 
                        I would love to visit there someday and go on a street-food tour. It can be very difficult to find the 
                        right Asian ingredients where I live, but I try not to let that stop me. ;^)</p>
