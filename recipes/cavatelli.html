                        <p>This is one of my favorite dishes to cook. It's super easy and theres always tons of leftovers. Definitely
                        dont make this if you don't like cheese or are lactose intolerant. Most of these ingredients are pretty interchangable.
                        You're adults, do what you want.</p>

                        <h3>How to make: </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fill a pot with water and add salt until it tastes like seawater then boil</li>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 400 deg Fahrenheit</li>
                            <li>Brown the ground pork in a seperate pan then reduce heat and continue until its cooked</li>
                            <li>Add dried pasta to the water and stir every few minutes until its al-dente. Strain</li>
                            <li>In the pot you cooked the pasta in add cooked pasta, ground pork, marinara, alfredo, garlic and
                                truffle seasoning. Stir until its all mixed together and the sauce is an orange-ish color</li>
                            <li>In a smaller pot add some of the pasta mixture and add little penny-sized dolops of ricotta over 
                                the pasta and mozzarella to top</li>
                            <li>Bake in the oven until pasta is hot and cheese is melted. I usually cook it a little longer until 
                                the cheese is carmalized on the outside</li>
                            <li>Top with basil and a little grated parmesan</li>
                            <li>Enjoy!</li>            
                        </ul>
