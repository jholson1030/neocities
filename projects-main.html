                    page that some kind of legitimate business would probably use. I got a little silly with the pictures near
                the end though...</li>

                scissors game you can play first to five with the computer. My first Javascript project :) With the things I learned from this project I feel semi-confident that 
                I could build one of those cool text adventure games... Maybe someday...</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="odin-sketchpad/sketch-index.html">Pixelart Sketchpad  </a> - My current pride and joy. A pixel 
                art sketchpad. You can change the pixel size  on the canvas. All complete with cat gifs if you need some further motivation. Just wrote a save
                and load function that once you close the page your sketches will be saved to local storage. Enjoy!</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="to-do-notepad/to-do-index.html">To-Do App</a> - A simple to-do app. I learned about local storage with this. I'll apply that information
                to my other projects. Especially the pixelart sketchpad.</li>
                <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="../odin-calculator/index.html">Calculator</a> - It's a calculator. This project about completely broke my brain. By the time I got
                all the javascript working I didn't even feel like spending much time styling it. Seriously though, fuck this project. </li>
