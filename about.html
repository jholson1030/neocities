                <h2>An introverted shut in with a love for food, technology and cats.</h2>
                <p>I used to be a chef. I've worked in kitchens since I was very young and went to culinary school after high school. About
                    5 years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy and eventually was forced to resign from cooking professionally. Now I work at
                    a market selling imported cheese and wine/beer/liquors. I'm very grateful that I still get to work with food in a much
                    less stressful enviornment. <br/> I started teaching myself web development in early 2022, i've always enjoyed learning
                    about technology. At first I was looking at it as a new career path but as I progressed I found that by looking at it as 
                    just a hobby has improved my learning. I love working on websites and projects. It's a good challenge that keeps me busy.
